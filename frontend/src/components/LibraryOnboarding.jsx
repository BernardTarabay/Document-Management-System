/**
 * What a library with no folders offers instead of nothing.
 *
 * WHY AN EMPTY LIBRARY IS THE RIGHT STARTING POINT
 *
 * New accounts used to be seeded with twelve folders -- Personal, Finance,
 * Administrative, Reference and some children -- so that the first visit had
 * something in it. The seeding is gone (see authService.register), because a
 * structure handed to someone before they have said anything is a structure
 * derived from nothing: it does not know whether they are filing a business, a
 * thesis, or twenty years of family paperwork. In practice the starter folders
 * became the taxonomy by default, since rearranging someone else's structure
 * costs more than accepting it, and documents then got forced into the
 * least-wrong bucket.
 *
 * But the reasoning behind the seeding was not wrong about the risk. An empty
 * tree with a "create your first folder" button IS a dead end -- it asks
 * someone who has not looked at their documents yet to invent a filing system
 * from memory, one folder at a time.
 *
 * So this is the other way out. The assistant can already create folders as a
 * real action (create_subject, and it can propose a whole set at once), which
 * means the fastest path from nothing to a working library is describing what
 * you have in a sentence. That path leads; making folders by hand stays for
 * people who already know exactly what they want.
 *
 * The suggestions are SENTENCE OPENERS, not commands. They land in the
 * composer for the user to finish, because the useful part is the detail only
 * they have -- the sentence is a way past the blank page, not a template.
