/**
 * "We could not load this", as distinct from "there is nothing here".
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * useApiData has always returned `error`, and almost every page threw it
 * away, destructuring only `{ data, loading }`. When a fetch failed, `data`
 * stayed null and the page fell through to its empty state -- so a backend
 * that was down, a query that 400'd, or an expired session all rendered as
 * "No files found. Register a storage location and run a scan to start
 * ingesting files."
 *
 * That is the worst possible thing to show, because it is a confident,
 * actionable lie: it tells someone whose 9,000-file repository is fine that
 * it is empty, and invites them to go re-scan it. Someone acting on that
 * advice is now debugging the wrong problem entirely.
 *
 * An error state has to be visibly different from an empty one and has to
 * offer the only useful action -- try again.
