/**
 * The state of the archive, in one line, above the Library.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A SECOND DASHBOARD
 *
 * The Dashboard answers "what is the pipeline doing" with a funnel, trend
 * charts and per-stage counters. That is a real question, asked occasionally
 * and on purpose. This answers a different one, asked every single time
 * someone opens the app: *how much of my stuff is sorted, and how much still
 * needs me?* Four numbers, one of which you can act on.
 *
 * The unfiled count is the important one and is a BUTTON, not a statistic.
 * Someone who has just pointed Atlas at a drive with twenty years of
 * accumulated files opens this page to a large number and needs the next
 * click to be obvious. A number you cannot click is a reproach.
