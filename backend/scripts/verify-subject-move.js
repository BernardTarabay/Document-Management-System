// Proves a folder can be dragged into another folder, branch and all.
//
// "I want to drag and drop a folder into another folder. I mean, that's just
//  basic file management. And when I move it under another one, it becomes a
//  category of that parent folder."
//
// WHY THE BRANCH IS THE WHOLE STORY
//
// The migration-029 trigger recomputes materialized_path, depth and level for
// the row being written -- and only that row. So the naive implementation
// (`UPDATE subjects SET parent_id = ...`) lands the dragged folder correctly
// and leaves every descendant claiming an ancestry it no longer has.
//
// That would not throw. It would quietly break the descendant-inclusive
// subject filter, the count rollup and the tree, all of which are built on
// materialized_path -- which is exactly why this script checks the GRANDCHILD
// after every move, not just the folder that was dragged.
//
