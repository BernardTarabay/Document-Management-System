// Proves a folder you no longer want can actually be deleted.
//
// THE REPORT THIS COMES FROM
//
//   "I'm trying to delete an old folder. It says Photos can't be deleted,
//    files have been filed under it in the past and that history is kept for
//    audit purposes. No. If I don't want it, I don't want it."
//
// The refusal came from classification_results.classified_subject_id being
// NO ACTION, so a folder that had EVER held a file was permanently
// undeletable -- even one whose files had long since moved elsewhere. The
// suggested workaround was to rename it, which leaves the clutter in place
// under a different name. On a library whose premise is that the tree belongs
// to the user, a folder that cannot be removed is a folder the software owns.
//
// WHAT MUST BE TRUE NOW
//
//   past history never blocks         migration 036: ON DELETE SET NULL
//   history is not destroyed          the row survives with its method,
//                                     confidence and timestamps; only the
//                                     pointer to a dead folder is dropped
//   documents are never deleted       they become unfiled and stay findable
//   consequences are named, not       a branch or filed documents require
//   silently applied                  force, and the message says how many
//
