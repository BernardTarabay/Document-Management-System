// Proves Archive and Trash behave like destinations and not like folders.
//
// WHAT WAS ASKED FOR
//
//   "an archive and trash section which act like folders but are undeletable
//    and you can't rename them, so like absolute paths, you can move any file
//    there, and the trash acts like a recycle bin and deletes files permanently
//    after a specific amount of time, while archive is just a way to hide
//    files/folders"
//
// WHY THEY ARE STATUSES, NOT SUBJECTS
//
// A subject says what a document is ABOUT; these say where it is in its LIFE.
// If they were folders, every listing, count and search in the application
// would need "...and not filed under Trash" bolted on, and the first query that
// forgot would show deleted documents as live ones. Being statuses makes
// "undeletable" and "unrenameable" free -- there is no row to delete or rename
// -- and makes disappearing from listings the default rather than a rule each
// query has to remember.
//
// The checks below are therefore mostly about ABSENCE: a file put away has to
// vanish from the listing, the count, the id sweep behind "select all" and the
// search, all four of which are separate queries that have drifted apart before.
//
