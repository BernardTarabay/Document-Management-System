// is called.
//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO STOP COMING BACK
//
// Asking the assistant for "the photo of two people hugging in a kitchen"
// failed, while asking for "WhatsApp Image 2026-07-29" succeeded. That looked
// like a search-quality problem and was not one: descriptionSearchService
// finds both files from a paraphrase, and always could. The assistant simply
// never called it. Its whole world was the current page plus the triage/photo
// backlog, and every file reached the model as `id | filename | path` with the
// path always empty -- so the filename was the only string it could match on,
// and on this archive the filenames are camera and WhatsApp exports that say
// nothing.
//
// Three failures, and any one of them alone reproduces the symptom:
//   1. no retrieval    -- the file was usually not in the context at all
//   2. no description  -- and if it was, the model got only its filename
//   3. wrong ORDER     -- see section 3; the fix for (1) had this bug in it
//
// This drives the REAL controller with the Gemini call stubbed out, rather
// than reimplementing its assembly here. A script that rebuilds the logic it
// is checking passes happily while the shipped path is broken -- and the
// ordering bug in section 3 was invisible to exactly that kind of script,
// because the reimplementation had the ordering right and the controller did
// not.
