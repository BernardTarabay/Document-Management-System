// Proves bulk move BY CRITERIA: "file everything matching this into that".
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR
//
// Every bulk filing path before this started from a set the user had already
// assembled -- ticked checkboxes, a photo grid, a triage queue, or one whole
// folder. None of them answered "move every file LIKE this", which is the only
// form the instruction can take once an archive is big enough that nobody is
// going to tick fifty thousand boxes. The assistant now proposes it as a single
// reviewable card (move_by_filter) instead of thousands of move_file actions.
//
// WHAT MUST HOLD, AND WHY EACH ONE BITES
//
//  1. The filter vocabulary is the UI's. If the assistant's `ext` meant
//     something different from the filter bar's `ext`, the card a user approved
//     would not be the set they were shown.
//  2. Files already in the destination are NOT re-filed. "Latest row wins", so
//     re-filing 50,000 unmoved files buries every real placement decision under
//     a wall of no-ops and costs 50,000 writes to change nothing.
//  3. The match set is snapshotted before work starts. `unfiled=true` stops
//     matching a file the moment it is filed, so a paging implementation skips
//     everything that moved out from under its OFFSET.
//  4. An empty filter is refused. It means the entire repository, which is a
//     legitimate thing to ask for and a catastrophic thing to do by accident.
//  5. Ownership holds. A filter is not a list of ids someone hand-checked.
