// Sizing the "Atlas keeps the files" option, from measured facts where they
// exist and stated assumptions where they do not.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A PARAGRAPH
//
// The question -- "what would it cost to let Atlas delete the originals?" --
// has one honest answer and several invented ones. The honest answer needs the
// real corpus measured, and the real corpus is not on this machine yet. So this
// separates the two: everything it can read from the database and the disk it
// reads, and everything else it takes as a named input and labels as an
// assumption, so nobody mistakes a projection for a measurement.
//
// Re-run it against the real archive once that is scanned and every number
// below becomes measured rather than assumed.
