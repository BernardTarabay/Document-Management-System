// Proves the scan recovers files whose processing work was lost, and -- just
// as important -- that it does NOT re-queue files that are simply waiting
// their turn.
//
// The failure this guards against is silent by nature: a file row exists, so
// the file shows up in the list, but it has no hash and no extracted text, so
// it is invisible to search. Before the fix, every later scan looked at that
// file, saw its size and mtime were unchanged, and skipped it forever.
//
// Four cases, because a recovery that over-fires is its own bug -- re-queueing
// everything on every scan would multiply the backlog an import is already
// stuck behind.
//
//   1. healthy      fully processed          -> must NOT be re-queued
//   2. lost         no hash, no job in flight -> MUST be re-queued
//   3. in flight    no hash, job queued       -> must NOT be re-queued
//   4. half done    hashed but no content     -> MUST be re-queued
