// Proves a file you already have is recognised WITHOUT being read.
//
// THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS
//
//   "If I know they're duplicates, why compute them in the first place? A scan
//    still happens, we hash all seven files, and only then deduce they're
//    duplicates."
//
// Correct, and the hash was the expensive half: sha256Stream reads every byte.
// knownContentService already made everything DOWNSTREAM of the hash free for
// an identical file; this moves the recognition earlier, to before the file is
// opened in full -- size and mtime from an index, then 64 KB from each end.
//
// WHAT MAKES THIS SCRIPT WORTH ANYTHING
//
// It MEASURES THE BYTES READ. Asserting "the shortcut fired" would pass just as
// happily if the shortcut fired and then something read the file anyway, which
// is the only failure that matters here -- the feature would look like it
// worked while saving nothing. So the storage layer is instrumented and the
// numbers below are actual I/O.
