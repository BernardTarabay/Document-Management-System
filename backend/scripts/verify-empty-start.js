// Proves a new account starts with NO folders, and that this is a starting
// point rather than a dead end.
//
// WHAT CHANGED AND WHY IT NEEDS HOLDING
//
// Registration used to seed twelve folders so the first visit had something in
// it. That reasoning was right about the risk -- an empty tree with a "create
// your first folder" button asks someone to invent a filing system from memory
// -- and wrong about the fix. A structure handed over before the user has said
// anything is derived from nothing, and in practice it BECAME the taxonomy,
// because rearranging someone else's structure costs more than accepting it.
// Documents then got forced into the least-wrong bucket, which is the exact
// failure the dynamic tree exists to end.
//
// So the folders are gone and the dead end is answered in the UI instead: the
// Library offers a conversation with the assistant, which can create the whole
// structure in one turn.
//
// This checks the half that can be checked from here -- that a real
// registration produces zero folders, that nothing else about the account is
// missing, and that the assistant can still build a tree from nothing.
//
