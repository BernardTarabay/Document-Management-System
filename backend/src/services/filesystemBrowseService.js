// Server-side folder picker for registering a storage location.
//
// Hand-typing an absolute path is error-prone (normalizeRootPath() exists
// purely to patch around Windows "Copy as path" quoting), so this lets a user
// click through the backend's own filesystem instead.
//
// WHY THIS IS CONFINABLE RATHER THAN PERMISSION-GATED
//
// The original note here said an unsandboxed picker was fine "because this
// route is gated behind the same user.manage permission as creating a storage
// location". That stopped being true: registering a location moved to
// `storage.manage`, because pointing the app at your own folder is not an act
// of user administration -- and leaving the picker on `user.manage` left the
// primary "Add storage location" button 403ing for exactly the accounts that
// had just been given permission to add one.
//
// A permission was never the right control anyway. On a machine serving two
// accounts the risk is that one enumerates the other's home directory, and no
// per-user scope can narrow a bare directory listing -- there is nothing on it
// to scope BY. Containment can. So browsing is confinable to an explicit set
// of roots via BROWSE_ROOTS.
//
// The DEFAULT is unconfined, which is a deliberate reversal -- see browseRoots
// below for why, and warnIfSharedAndUnconfined for how the risk is surfaced
// when it actually arises.
//
// It returns directory NAMES only, never file contents.

/**
 * Where browsing is allowed to reach.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT IS UNCONFINED, AND THAT IS A REVERSAL
 *
 * This first shipped defaulting to the backend account's home directory, on
 * the reasoning that a shared server must not let one account enumerate
 * another's files. The reasoning is still right; the default was still wrong,
 * and measurably so -- on a normal Windows install it filtered out every
 * drive including C:\, so the picker offered no drives at all and a folder on
 * D:\ was unreachable. Defending against a second account that does not exist,
 * by breaking the primary function of the application for the account that
 * does, is the wrong trade.
 *
 * This app's actual deployment is self-hosted on the user's own desktop --
 * `fileService.revealInFileManager` spawns the host OS file manager and says
 * so outright. On that machine the backend's filesystem IS the user's
 * filesystem, and a picker that cannot see their external drive is a picker
 * that does not work.
 *
 * So: open by default, confinable by configuration, and the risk is surfaced
 * at boot exactly when it becomes real -- see warnIfSharedAndUnconfined,
 * which fires only once a second account exists.
 *
 *   BROWSE_ROOTS unset      no confinement (the desktop case)
 *   BROWSE_ROOTS=*          the same, stated explicitly
 *   BROWSE_ROOTS=C:\;E:\    exactly these (the shared-server case)
 *
 * @returns {string[]|null} null means no confinement

 * one user's home directory to another. Checking at startup catches the moment
 * the assumption stops holding, which is the only moment it matters -- and it
 * warns rather than clamping down, because silently narrowing the picker after
 * someone registers a second account would break the first account's setup for
