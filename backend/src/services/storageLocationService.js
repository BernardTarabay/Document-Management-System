// Storage locations, now owned.
//
// WHAT CHANGED AND WHY
//
// Registering a folder used to require `user.manage` -- the permission for
// creating and deactivating other people's ACCOUNTS. Nothing about pointing
// this app at your own Documents folder is an act of user administration, and
// the conflation had a concrete cost: the only account on this install holds
// the `User` role, so it could not perform the first step the application
// exists for. The route is now gated on `storage.manage`, and every function
// here takes the acting user and scopes its queries to them.
//
// Ownership is enforced by the QUERY, not by a check after the fact:
// `findByIdForOwner` returns null for somebody else's location, which becomes
// a 404. There is deliberately no code path that loads a location by id alone
// and then compares owners -- that shape invites the check being skipped.
