// Archive and Trash -- the two destinations that are not folders.
//
// WHAT THEY ARE
//
//   Archive   "I do not want to see this, but I am not throwing it away."
//             Hidden from every listing, count and search. Kept forever.
//             Reversible at any time, with nothing scheduled against it.
//
//   Trash     "Throw this away." Hidden the same way, and REMOVED FROM THE
//             DATABASE after a retention window (env.trash.retentionDays).
//             Reversible until that window closes, and not afterwards.
//
// They look like folders in the tree because that is the shape of the gesture
// people already have -- drag a thing onto a place -- but they are statuses,
// not subjects. The reasoning is in migration 037: a subject says what a
// document is ABOUT, and these say where it is in its LIFE. Modelling them as
// folders would mean every listing query in the application growing an "...and
// not filed under Trash" clause, and every query that forgot showing deleted
// documents as live ones.
//
// WHAT "PERMANENTLY DELETE" DOES AND DOES NOT MEAN
//
// It removes Atlas's ROW. It does not touch the bytes on your disk -- this
// application never moves or deletes the originals it indexes, and a purge is
// no exception. A purged file that still exists on disk will be re-imported by
// the next scan of its storage location, which is correct: the file is still
// there, and Atlas is a catalogue of what is there.
