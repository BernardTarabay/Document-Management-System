// Triage: the one place collecting everything the pipeline could not
// confidently handle -- and, now, the place those files get resolved.
//
// WHAT CHANGED
//
// This service used to own three verbs: LIST, COUNT, RETRY. Everything else
// was "go and do it on the Files page", on the reasoning that a second code
// path for renaming is how the read-only guard and the audit entry end up
// applying on one page and not the other.
//
// That reasoning is right and is kept. What was wrong was the conclusion: the
// fix is not to withhold the action, it is to have ONE implementation that
// both pages call. So the verbs below delegate -- moving calls
// fileOrganizeService (and therefore the duplicate guard), renaming calls
// fileService.updateFile (and therefore the read-only guard and filename
// validation). Nothing here reimplements them.
//
// The result is that a file in triage can be resolved where it is found,
// which is what makes it a worklist rather than a list of complaints.
