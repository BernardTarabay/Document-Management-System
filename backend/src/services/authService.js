   * A NEW ACCOUNT STARTS WITH NO FOLDERS, DELIBERATELY.
   *
   * This used to seed twelve -- Personal/Finance/Administrative/Reference and
   * some children -- reasoning that "the very first visit shows a usable page
   * instead of an empty tree with a 'create your first folder' dead end". The
   * dead end was the real problem; the folders were the wrong fix for it.
   *
   * Handing someone a structure invites them to file into it, and it is a
   * structure derived from nothing: it does not know whether they are filing a
   * business, a thesis or twenty years of family paperwork. What actually
   * happened is that the starter folders became the taxonomy by default,
   * because the cost of rearranging someone else's structure is higher than
   * the cost of accepting it -- and then documents got forced into the
   * least-wrong bucket, which is the failure the dynamic tree exists to end.
   *
   * So the empty tree stays and the dead end goes: the Library now opens onto
   * a choice between making a folder and describing the archive to the
   * assistant, which can build the whole structure in one conversation
   * (create_subject has been a real action all along). An empty library is an
   * honest starting point -- nobody has told us anything yet.
   *
   * The device row is still created here, because that is infrastructure
   * rather than a filing decision, and is not allowed to fail the
   * registration: someone whose account rolled back over a device row has no
   * account at all, which is strictly worse.
