// One outgoing-call budget for the whole process, shared by every Gemini
// caller.
//
// WHY THIS WAS EXTRACTED
//
// This sliding window lived inside geminiClassifier.js, private to it. That
// was correct while the classifier was the only thing calling Gemini, and it
// stopped being correct the moment it wasn't: imageDescriber already called
// the API without passing through it, and describing files adds three more
// callers (text summaries, image/video/audio description, embeddings).
//
// Four private limiters each pacing at env.ai.rateLimitPerMinute do not
// enforce that limit -- they enforce four times it, which on the free tier
// (15 requests/minute for gemini-3.1-flash-lite, seen firsthand in the 429
// body) is a burst straight through the quota. A quota is a property of the
// API key, so the window that paces it has to be a property of the process,
// not of whichever module happens to be calling.
//
// The behaviour is deliberately unchanged from the classifier's original: a
// call WAITS for a free slot rather than being refused one, and acquisition is
// serialized through a single promise chain so concurrent callers cannot all
// read the same "under the limit" snapshot and proceed together.
