// The file lifecycle, written down once.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG BEFORE
//
// A file's position in the pipeline was never recorded -- it was inferred,
// differently, by everything that needed to know. "Is this file done?" was
// answered by asking whether it had a hash, whether it had a file_content
// row, what its text_quality said, and whether a job was in flight; and
// triageRepository, fileRepository.listUnprocessed, dashboardRepository and
// the scan's recovery pass each asked a slightly different combination.
//
// That is the mechanism behind "retrying a triaged file just sends it back to
// triage". The retry re-ran a stage, the stage genuinely succeeded, and the
// file still matched the stuck predicate -- because the predicate was about a
// permanent property of the document (a photograph has no text layer) rather
// than about progress. Nothing counted the laps, so it could happen forever.
//
// THE STATES, AND WHAT EACH ONE PROMISES
//
//   discovered        indexed; no stage has run
//   processing        a stage is queued or running
//   needs_user        the machine has done everything it can. A RESTING
//                     state, not an error: this is what "in triage" means,
//                     and a file here is waiting on a decision, not on a
//                     retry
//   completed         processed as far as this file can go, and filed
//   failed_retryable  a stage failed and retrying is still worth doing
//   failed_terminal   retried to the limit, or failed for a reason retrying
//                     cannot change
//   archived          withdrawn from the working set by the user
//
// Every file is in exactly one. The three terminal-ish states (completed,
// needs_user, failed_terminal, archived) are terminal for the PIPELINE -- a
// human can always move a file out of them, which is the point of the triage
// workspace.
//
// WHY RETRIES ARE COUNTED PER STAGE
//
// A file that failed extraction twice and then failed classification once has
// not "failed three times". A single counter would strand it early, and a
// counter that resets on every new stage would never stop anything. The count
// lives in a JSONB map keyed by stage.
