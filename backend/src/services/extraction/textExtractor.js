// Plain-text and text-markup extraction (spec §7/§8).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// docs/07-supported-formats.md finalized the format list after investigating
// what could reliably be extracted from each, and plain text was never
// considered -- not listed as supported, not listed as a limitation. So a
// .txt fell through to the "anything else" row and was ingested as an
// unsupported binary: hashed, browsable, and holding zero characters of text.
//
// That is the worst possible answer for the one format that needs no parsing
// at all, because the bytes ARE the text. And it cascades: no text means no
// classification, no document date read from content, no rename proposal, a
// facts-only description, and nothing to search on. A 3 KB CV in this
// repository was invisible to every one of those.
//
// Detection reaches here by extension, not signature, and that is correct
// rather than a compromise: plain text has no magic bytes to detect. It also
// means the subtype list below has to be an ALLOWLIST. Claiming every
// signature-less file as text would decode unknown binaries into mojibake and
// feed it to the classifier, which is the failure mode fileSignature.js's
// "content wins over a lying extension" rule exists to prevent -- an
// extension is only trusted here for extensions that genuinely denote text.
