// Optical character recognition, via the native Tesseract binary.
//
// WHY A BINARY AND NOT A LIBRARY
//
// The alternative was tesseract.js, a WASM build that downloads its language
// data at runtime. For this corpus -- French and Arabic scans -- that is
// 30-40MB of traineddata fetched on first use, decoded in-process, and an
// order of magnitude slower per page. The native binary is a one-time install
// and reads the same traineddata from disk.
//
// The cost is that it is an EXTERNAL dependency the app does not control. So
// this module treats "tesseract is not installed" as a first-class, reported
// state rather than an exception: `ocr_status = 'unavailable'` with a message
// naming the install command. Nothing here ever fabricates text, and a file
// whose OCR could not run keeps its original name and stays visible in the
// Photos workspace -- which is the honest outcome, and the one the user can
// act on.
//
// WHY NOT WINDOWS.MEDIA.OCR
//
// It is genuinely good and needs no install, but it is Windows-only and
// reachable only through a PowerShell/WinRT bridge. Making the OCR engine
// platform-specific would mean this feature quietly does nothing the day the
// backend moves to a Linux box, which is exactly the class of surprise the
// rest of this codebase avoids.
