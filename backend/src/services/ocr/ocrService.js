// OCR for one file, end to end: decide whether it is needed, get the bytes,
// rasterise if the format requires it, recognise, and record the result.
//
// WHERE THE RESULT GOES, AND WHY NOT INTO file_content
//
// OCR text is written to `file_ocr`, NOT to `file_content.extracted_text`.
// They are different claims: one is text the document actually contained, the
// other is a machine's reading of a picture. Collapsing them would let the
// naming pipeline treat a 42%-confidence guess at a blurry receipt as if it
// were an embedded text layer, and this codebase already learned that lesson
// the hard way -- see textQuality.js and the note in NEXT-SESSION.md about
// never letting the AI name a file from unreadable text.
//
// What OCR text IS used for: search, display in the Photos workspace, and as
// context the user can read before deciding where a document belongs. Naming
// from it requires the confidence to clear a bar, and even then it is offered
// as a proposal rather than applied.
