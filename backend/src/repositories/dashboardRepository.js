// Aggregates for the dashboard.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// The dashboard used to fetch `/files?limit=200` and render `files.length`.
// On a 9,398-file repository it therefore reported "200 files tracked" -- not
// a rounding error, a hard ceiling, and the same bug applied to proposals,
// duplicates and jobs. It also dragged 200 fully-decorated file rows across
// the wire (each with a subject lateral join and a rename-proposal lateral
// join) purely to take the length of the array.
//
// Counting is the database's job. Everything here is a COUNT/SUM over the
// whole table, so the numbers are true at any scale and the payload is a few
// hundred bytes instead of a few hundred rows.
//
// The one deliberate exception is the jobs window: "what has the pipeline
// been doing lately" is a genuinely time-bounded question, so it is scoped to
// a recent interval and says so on screen.

const db = require("../config/database");
const { requireOwner } = require("./ownership");

// A row that belongs to the caller by way of the file it describes. Used by
// the subqueries over rename_proposals and file_content, neither of which
// carries an owner column -- ownership of a proposal is not an independent
// fact, it is a consequence of which file the proposal is about.
const OWNED_FILE = (fileIdExpr) =>
  `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM files of WHERE of.id = ${fileIdExpr} AND of.owner_user_id = $1)`;

// A file counts as "in the repository" unless it has been deleted. Missing
// files (the drive is unplugged) still count -- they are known documents, and
// hiding them would make the total silently shrink when a disk goes offline.
