// The triage queue: every file the pipeline could not confidently handle,
// in one place, with the reason attached.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// The failures were all already recorded -- they were just recorded in six
// different places, none of which was a list you could work through.
// `file_content.text_quality` said a document was unreadable, `needs_ocr`
// said OCR would help, a missing `file_content` row said the work was
// dropped, a failed `processing_jobs` row said a stage errored, and
// `files.status = 'missing'` said the bytes are gone. A user's actual
// question -- "which of my files did this thing fail on, and what do I do
// about each one?" -- had no answer short of running SQL.
//
// The consequence was worse than inconvenience: an error stalled the
// pipeline silently. A file with no content row is invisible to search,
// looks identical to one that simply has not been reached yet, and nothing
// on any page said otherwise.
//
// ONE QUERY, NOT SIX
//
// Every reason is derived in a single CASE over one pass of `files`, so a
// file appears exactly once under its most serious reason rather than once
// per problem it has. That also makes the queue filterable and countable by
// reason without the API pulling rows into JS to categorize them -- the same
// argument dashboardRepository makes for counting in SQL.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN HERE
//
// Files with a queued or running job. They are not stuck, they are waiting
// their turn, and a big import would otherwise dump tens of thousands of
// perfectly healthy files into a queue meant to hold the exceptions. The
// summary reports that number separately so a shrinking triage list during
// an import is legible rather than mysterious.

const { requireOwner } = require("./ownership");

// Identical to the predicate in fileRepository.countBacklogByLocation and
// dashboardRepository.attention, on purpose: "stalled" must mean the same
// number on the Storage Locations page, the dashboard and here, or one of
// the three looks like a bug. ('retrying' is in the job_status enum but no
// processor ever writes it -- see runProcessingJob.js.)

// BullMQ retries a failed job up to three times with exponential backoff
// (queues/index.js), and the processing_jobs row sits at 'failed' in between
// attempts -- so a job that is about to succeed on attempt two looks
// identical to one that has given up. The grace window is comfortably longer

/**
 * The reason CASE, in priority order -- a file with three problems is listed
 * under the most serious one, because that is the one whose fix comes first.
 *
 * Two subtleties worth not "simplifying" away:
 *
 *   text_quality IS NULL is NOT a problem. NULL means "indexed before the
 *   quality check existed, never judged", which migration 023 deliberately
 *   keeps distinct from 'ok'. Treating it as unreadable would drop the entire
 *   pre-023 backfill into the queue as if it had failed.
 *
 *   The last job is matched on payload->>'fileId', so repository-wide jobs
 *   (scan, bulk_rename, bulk_delete) can never be attributed to a single
 *   file -- their payloads have no fileId.
 *
 * THE TWO TEXT-QUALITY REASONS CLEAR WHEN THE FILE HAS BEEN NAMED
 *
 * `needs_ocr` and `unreadable` are not really "this file is broken" -- they
 * are "the pipeline could not name this file, so it needs you". Once a
 * canonical name exists, that request has been answered, and leaving the row
 * in the queue forever would mean the queue can never be emptied, which is
 * the difference between a worklist and a wall of text. The other four
 * reasons are genuine pipeline gaps and a name does not fix them.
 *
 * Caveat worth knowing: `canonical_filename` is what a rename writes on a
 * READ-ONLY location (the deployment this runs in -- see
 * fileRepository.setCanonicalName). A manual rename on a WRITABLE location
 * renames the real file and updates filename_current instead, so such a file
 * stays listed here with its new name showing. That is visible and mildly
 * annoying rather than wrong; giving it a "dismissed" flag would be a new
 * piece of state, and inventing one was not worth it for a case this
 * deployment does not hit.
