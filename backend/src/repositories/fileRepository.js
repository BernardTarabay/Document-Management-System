 * An already-processed file with byte-for-byte identical content.

 * proposal. On a repository assembled from overlapping backups that is the

 * plus the handful of files that are genuinely new. The result was hours of
 * work and thousands of review items to arrive at facts already in the
 * database.
 *
 * Identical bytes cannot extract to different text, so anything downstream of
 * hashing can be adopted from the twin instead of recomputed (see
 * services/knownContentService.js).
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A USABLE TWIN
 *
 *   not deleted        a removed file's results are still true, but adopting
 *                      from one would quietly resurrect a decision the user
 *                      made about it.
 *   has file_content   the marker that extraction actually finished. Without
 *                      it there is nothing to adopt, and the new file must go
 *                      through the pipeline normally.
 *   extraction not
 *   'failed'           a failed extraction is a state to retry, not to
 *                      propagate. Adopting one would turn a single broken
 *                      file into a hundred, all of them looking settled.
 *   not a placeholder  a cloud placeholder was skipped, not processed.
 *
 *   IS CLASSIFIED     the twin's latest classification actually puts it
 *                     somewhere. See below -- this one is load-bearing.
 *
 * WHY THE CLASSIFICATION REQUIREMENT EXISTS
 *
 * "Has a file_content row" was the only completeness test, and it is not one.
 * file_content is written at the end of extract_text, but extract_metadata,
 * classify and generate_names are SEPARATE QUEUES with their own backlogs, so
 * during any sizeable import the normal state of a twin is "text extracted,
 * nothing else yet".
 *
 * Adopting from a twin in that state was silently destructive. adoptFrom
 * copies whatever exists at that instant, so the new file inherited text and
 * nothing else -- no classification, therefore no subject. hashProcessor then
 * RETURNS EARLY on the adoption path, so it never enqueues the analysis stages
 * either. And listUnprocessed, the self-healing rescan, skips any file that
 * has both a hash and a file_content row -- which this file now does.
 *
 * The result: a file with text, no subject, no metadata, no proposal, absent
 * from the shortcut mirror entirely (listForMirror requires a canonical name
 * or a subject path), and invisible to every recovery mechanism in the system.
 * Permanently. On the exact workload -- a big overlapping import -- this
 * feature was written for.
 *
 * Requiring a real classification means an adoption always carries the thing
 * that files the document. A twin that has not got there yet simply is not a
 * twin worth adopting from, and the new file takes the ordinary pipeline,
 * which is the correct outcome and the one that used to happen anyway.
 *
 * Ordered so the BEST-developed twin wins: one that has been classified and
 * named carries more to inherit than one that has only been extracted, and
 * the earliest import breaks ties so the choice is stable across runs rather
 * than depending on which row the planner happened to return first.
 *
 * WHY THE OWNER IS REQUIRED HERE
 *
 * Adoption copies extracted text, metadata, document date, classification and
 * the AI summary from the twin. Without an owner scope, the twin could be
 * another account's file -- so registering a folder containing a common
 * document (a bank's standard terms, a government form) would silently import
 * a stranger's AI-generated summary of it, their subject placement, and the
 * document date they had corrected by hand. Nothing in the UI would say where
 * any of it came from. Same bytes is not same document once there is more
 * than one archive.

 * `archived` file, or a duplicate copy, was listed, was counted, and was then
 * left out of the selection with no message -- `capped` is false, so nothing
 * fired. The visible symptom was the unfiled pile refusing to empty. You file
 * "all 40", the tile still says 3, and the loop the Library is built around
 * (open the pile, select it, file it, watch the number drop) quietly stops
 * being true, with nothing on screen explaining why.

 * signal ranks a different table; both produce bare file ids that never passed
 * through buildFilterSql. Fusing them with the filtered signal put files back
 * into the result that every filter on screen excluded -- searching inside one
 * subject returned documents from other subjects and other storage locations,
 * which is precisely the "a filter must NARROW a search, not be replaced by
 * it" contract that scripts/verify-search-filters.js exists to hold.
 *
 * Gating the fused set here keeps the ranking intact (this decides membership,
 * never order) and keeps one definition of what a filter means, which is the
 * whole argument in the header of fileFilters.js.
