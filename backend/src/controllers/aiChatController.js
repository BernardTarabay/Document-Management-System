   * context plus the backlog below -- at most a couple of hundred files out of
   * thousands -- and each one reached the model as a bare filename. So asking
   * for "the photo of two people hugging in a kitchen" failed while asking for
   * "WhatsApp Image 2026-07-29" succeeded, and the difference was not search
   * quality: the description was never sent, and the file was usually not in
   * the context in the first place. The only string the model could match on
   * was the filename.
   *
   * The archive already knows how to answer that question --
   * descriptionSearchService fuses meaning, description wording and
   * content/filename, and it finds both of those files from a paraphrase. It
   * simply was never wired to the assistant. This is that wire.
   *
   * Failure is non-fatal on purpose. If the embedding call cannot be made (no
   * key, daily cap reached) the semantic half reports `ran: false` and the
   * lexical description half still runs, so retrieval degrades to keyword
   * matching over descriptions rather than disappearing. A search that throws
   * outright must not take the conversation down with it -- the assistant is
   * still useful with only the page in front of it, which is what it had

   * equivalent and was not: every unfiled photo is in the backlog, so the top
   * search hit for "people hugging in a kitchen" was demoted out of the
   * retrieval block and re-listed in backlog order, below screenshots of
   * cryptography diagrams. Position IS the signal here -- dropping a file from
