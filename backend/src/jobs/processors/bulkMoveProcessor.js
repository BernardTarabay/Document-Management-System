// "File everything matching THIS into THAT" -- the bulk move by criteria.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// Every bulk filing action in the app until now started from a set the user
// had already assembled by hand: a page of ticked checkboxes, a photo grid, a
// triage queue, or the whole of one subject (move_subject_contents). All of
// them answer "move these files", and none of them answers "move every file
// LIKE this", which is the question someone with tens of thousands of
// documents actually has. "Put every 2019 invoice from the old NAS under
// Archive/2019" is not expressible as a list of ids you could realistically
// tick, and asking the assistant to enumerate them one move_file at a time
// turns one instruction into thousands of round trips.
//
// WHY IT IS A JOB AND NOT A REQUEST
//
// jobs/index.js used to note that `bulk_move` had no processor because "filing
// a document under a subject is a database-only operation handled
// synchronously by fileOrganizeService, so it never needed a queue". That
// held while the caller always had a hand-picked list in front of it. A filter
// does not have a size limit the user can see before they run it -- the same
// sentence can match nine files or ninety thousand -- so the work has to be
// something they can watch, walk away from, and see the result of on the
// Processing Jobs page, rather than a request that appears to hang.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
//
// It does not implement filing. It resolves a filter to a set of ids and then
// loops fileOrganizeService.moveManyToSubject exactly like the Library's bulk
// filing does, so every per-file duplicate check, ownership check and audit
// entry applies identically. A second filing implementation is the "four
// callers, four implementations" failure that module's header warns about, and
// the one that skips a check is always the fastest one written last.
