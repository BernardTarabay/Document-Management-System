   * Document type asks "what KIND of thing is this" (docs/03-taxonomy.md
   * §3.4), and prose does not answer that at all. The narrative that broke
   * this axis says "presentation" four times, every one of them about a person

   * presentation", so the rule tier stops guessing and leaves the axis to the
   * two signals that can actually carry it -- the filename a person chose, and
   * an extension that settles the question outright -- plus the AI tier, which
   * reads the document, and a human, who can set it from the Files page.
   *
   * Consequence, stated plainly: the rule tier now assigns FEWER types. On a
   * French/Arabic corpus with an English seed list it will usually assign
   * none. An empty axis is recoverable; an axis full of confident nonsense
